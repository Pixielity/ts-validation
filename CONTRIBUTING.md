# Contributing to Mapped Types

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Mapped Types as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Testing

We use Jest for testing. Run the tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

### Coding Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce a consistent coding style. Run the linter with:

```bash
npm run lint
```

And format your code with:

```bash
npm run format
```
